# HBNB Project

Welcome to the HBNB project repository. This project is a comprehensive application that simulates the functionality of a web-based hospitality service, similar to Airbnb. It encompasses a custom backend API, a database integration for data persistence, and a front-end interface for user interactions.

## Overview

The HBNB project is designed to demonstrate a full-stack development skill set, including front-end web development, back-end server management, API development, and database schema design. The project is structured to mimic real-world applications and provides a hands-on approach to understanding the intricacies of web application development.
